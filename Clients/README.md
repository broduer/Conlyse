### Features

#### Dashboard
[![Dashboard](https://github.com/zDox/Conlyse/blob/master/examples/Dashboard.png?raw=true "Dashboard")](https://github.com/zDox/Conlyse/blob/master/examples/Dashboard.png?raw=true "Dashboard")

The dashboard consists of 8 components and most of them are pretty self-explanatory, but I bravely want to talk about Rising Powers.
Rising Powers show the top three countries sorted by highest gained victory points in the last 5 days.


#### Country List

The country list consists of a table where every country can be sorted by different attributes. Just play around and have fun with all the options you can choose from.
