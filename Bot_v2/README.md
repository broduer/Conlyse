# Bot

## Installation

1. Install [chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/, "chrome")
2. Install the [chrome drivers](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads, "chrome drivers") so selenium is able to control chrome

## Things to keep in mind
- the Bot should run on a server, so it can always make requests to the "Conflict of Nations" backend
- It's not a big deal if the bot misses one or two cron job, but also it won't gather data in that time.
